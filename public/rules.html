        <h1>Welcome to Dungeon Dice</h1>
        <p>Embark on an adventurous journey through dungeons filled with dangers and treasures. Use your wits and dice to navigate through challenging scenarios and emerge victorious!</p>

        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To play Dice Dungeon, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A set of standard six-sided dice (d6).</li>
            <li>Each player will need one d6 dice and one four-sided dice (d4).</li>
            <li>Dungeon tiles or a way to represent the dungeon layout. Please see the readme at <a href="https://github.com/pballard101/dungeondice">HERE</a></li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2 id="play">How to Play!</h2>
        <p>Start by placing the first dungeon tile and positioning each player's character, represented by a d6, on the tile. Place one door on the tile to indicate an exit or entrance.<br>
        Determine order of the hero dice, this stays the same the entire game. That player can now take the turn<br>
        When a door is opened, click the draw card button the app. <br>
        When the tile is cleared or completed, roll a d6 if its an even number place 2 doors anywhere you like in the room if its an odd number place 1<br>
        Each player starts with 3 lives and a maximum health of 6. <br>
        Adjust the d6 to represent current health. When damaged by enemies or cards<br>
        Losing all health results in a loss of one life and restarting with full health.<br>
        If any player loses all lives, the scenario is restarted.</p>

        <h2 id="player-turn">Player Turn</h2>
        <p>Each player can perform two actions per turn in any order. The actions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Move:</strong> Roll a d6 to determine how many spaces you can move. Move your character after the roll</li>
            <li><strong>Melee Attack:</strong> Attack an adjacent enemy by rolling a d6 for damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Ranged Attack:</strong> Attack an ememy dice one tile away or diagonally with d4 for damage. You can shoot through allies but not enemies</li>
            <li><strong>Heal:</strong> Roll a d4 to heal yourself, adjacent, or diagonally ally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="enemies">Enemies Turn</h2>
        <p>Enemies always go second in inititive. When you open a door the hero's will get to finish their current cycle of turns before the enemies turn.<br>
        Enemies on the board will move and attack during their turn.<br> 
        Roll a 1d6 for the enemies to move Enemies target the closest player or the last player to attack them. In case of equal distance, the players decide who gets attacked.<br>
        Enemies roll a 1d4 and can only do malee attacks</p>
