## About This Repository
This repository is more than just code; it's a portal to endless adventures. Here's what makes DungeonDice special:

- **Browser-Based State Management:** The game's state is stored in your browser. Refreshing the browser means restarting the adventure, adding an element of excitement and unpredictability.
- **Extensibility and Creativity:** Both obstacle tiles and rewards are designed to be flexible and not mission-specific. This means the game can grow and evolve with community contributions.
- **Community Contributions:** Adding new obstacles is straightforward. Clone an obstacle tile, make your modifications, and voila â€“ you've contributed to the DungeonDice universe!

## How to Contribute

### Adding a Mission
1. **Edit Missions:** Start by editing `missions.json` in the missions folder.
2. **Create a Mission Folder:** Match the folder name to your JSON file.
3. **Story Tiles:** Add JSON blobs for each story tile in your mission.
4. **Leverage Game Mechanics:** Story tiles can invoke functions in `main.js`. For example, see how `mission1/storytile2.json` uses a timer. Feel free to use and expand upon these mechanics.
5. **Dynamic Grid System:** Any story tile can dynamically interact with the grid system. Check out `mission1/storyTile3` for an exciting boss fight example!
